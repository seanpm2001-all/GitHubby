# README: GitHub Limits

Through my time on GitHub, I have come across some limitations. For example, when I accidentally select a batch of files that contain a file larger than GitHubs 25 Megabyte limit, all the uploads will crash and I will get an error. If I were to upload 101 or more files at once, I would instantly get an error.

With GitHubby, through the file viewer of the browser, these limits will be pointed out to you before you upload the files. You can even choose to prevent them from showing up.
