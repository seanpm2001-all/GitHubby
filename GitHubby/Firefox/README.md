# Readme for Firefox trunk

This is the Firefox trunk of the GitHubby extension. It is designed to work in Firefox 4 to 77. It contains all the necessary scripts for the Firefox version of the GitHubby extension.

The Quantum versions are written in JavaScript, and the pre-Quantum versions are written in XUL and JavaScript.

I am very new to making browser extensions, so if I make any severe errors, please not only report them, but give me a description on how to correct it, I have never done this before (created a browser extension)
